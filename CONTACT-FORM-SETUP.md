# Contact Form Setup Instructions

## How the Contact Form Works

The contact form is configured to send emails to: **malaveekasridhar20072004@gmail.com**

## First-Time Setup (IMPORTANT!)

FormSubmit requires a one-time activation. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Submit a Test Message
1. Go to the Contact page on your website
2. Fill out the form with any test information
3. Click "Send Message"

### Step 2: Check Your Email
1. Check the inbox of **malaveekasridhar20072004@gmail.com**
2. You will receive an email from FormSubmit with subject: "Activate Form"
3. **Click the activation link** in that email

### Step 3: Done!
After clicking the activation link, all future form submissions will be automatically sent to your email!

## What Happens After Activation

- Every form submission will be sent directly to malaveekasridhar20072004@gmail.com
- You'll receive an email with all the details (name, email, phone, message)
- The user will see a success message
- No email client will open - it all happens automatically

## Email Format

You'll receive emails with:
- Subject: "New Contact Form Submission - Liver Cure"
- Sender's Name
- Sender's Email
- Sender's Phone Number
- Their Message

## Troubleshooting

If you don't receive the activation email:
1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Make sure the email address is correct
3. Try submitting the form again

## Alternative: Check Spam Folder

Sometimes the activation email goes to spam. Make sure to check there!
